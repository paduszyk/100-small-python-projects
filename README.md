## :bulb: Aims and scope
This repository is to present my individual studies on Python programming by means of implementing the projects proposed in the book [The Big Book of Small Python Projects](https://nostarch.com/big-book-small-python-projects) by Al Sweigart.

## :computer: Projects
Development of each project is presented within a separate branch. Look there if you want to see how some projects were (or are still) growing.

The final versions merged to `master`.
