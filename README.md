## :bulb: Aims and scope
This repository summarizes my individual studies on Python programming by means of developing the projects proposed in the book [The Big Book of Small Python Projects](https://nostarch.com/big-book-small-python-projects) by Al Sweigart. Implementations are based on my ideas, which may be consistent or completely different compared to those the original solutions from the book.

## :computer: Projects
Each project is presented within a separate branch. Look there if you want to see how some projects were growing. The final versions were nevertheless merged to `master`, so look for the optimized versions therein.
